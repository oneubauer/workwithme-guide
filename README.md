### Communication:

- I prefer to start conversations by getting right to the point, I tend top be very direct. That said, I'm happy to make a connection if it is genuine.
- I enjoy text-based chat as it allows me to respond asynchronously while still keeping a record of any details.
- A Zoom chat can be instrumental in quickly getting a lot of ideas on the table, especially when discussing a new topic that either party is unfamiliar with.
- I don't mind emojis and gifs, but I use them sparingly.

### Thinking and Decision Making:

- I'm a "slow thinker" and like to have time to digest information and discuss options with others. I can make snap decisions, but I'm always a little wary of them. On the flipside, I do usual come to a point where I realize that there might be no right answer and I just have to choose the least-bad option.
- I require clear direction, a desired outcome, and some parameters and constraints to do great work.

### Collaboration:

- I value an environment where people feel free to ask simple questions that may seem obvious to some. I find it's very good to strip away assumptions and free people from anxiety around being in the dark or unclear about things.
- I love the freedom to put forth a potentially bad idea. I've seen so-called Bad Ideas turn out to work, in some form. Either way, they can sometimes egenrate a productive conversation and engage a team.
- Please provide feedback directly, respectfully, and constructively to help me improve. I'm extremely self-critical, so it's likely I will be blindsinded by something you've noticed that I need help with. If you have a perspective and/or suggestions to help me progress, that's always welcome.

### What to Avoid:

- Bureaucracy, yak shaving, and micro-managing can be frustrating and hinder productivity. If it's serious and not self-aware or done without a sense of humour and tolerance, smug nitpicking drives me crazy.
- I'm not a big fan of discussing process overmuch (ie team retros etc) especially if there isn't a perceived problem to be solved. 



I'm looking forward to working with you and creating something amazing together!
